Four shock isolating systems are provided, each extending from front to rear of a housing, holding on a pair of corners and the joint of the side walls between the corners. The corner cap is made of corrugated metal and the shock absorbing material secured with an adhesive between the corner cap and the inner angle. The shock absorbing material deflects through a small distance in the first region and deflects through more distance in the second region. The corner cap and the shock absorbing material perform a stirring action among the corners during the impact load and absorbs the shock.\n\nIn loudspeaker cabinets.\n\nOffers an improved shock absorbing system without adding much weight of size to housing.",

		"patentAbstract": "A material-testing device for applying force to a test specimen includes a frictionless suspension that operates without sliding contact between an armature assembly and the suspension.\n\nA material-testing device for applying force to a test specimen comprises (a) a linear motor (10) comprising an armature assembly (14) that is coupled to the test specimen; (b) a stator assembly (12); and (c) a suspension element (16) for supporting the armature and for controlling the motion of the armature relative to the stator assembly and to the test specimen (18). The suspension is arranged and constructed to operate without sliding contact between the armature assembly and the suspension. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an electromechanical actuator assembly comprising:\n(1) a structure of low reluctance material;\n(2) a coil wound on the structure with planar opposing faces;\n(3) an air gap between the opposing faces;\n(4) a movable permanent magnet assembly, having regions of opposite polarity, disposed in and filling the air gap;and\n(5) a frictionless suspension assembly supporting the permanent magnet assembly and having different stiffness along each of the three axes.\nThe suspension is stiffest along the first axis.\n\nIn frictionless motor material testing.\n\nThe invention has improved suspension. When the compliant layer compresses, it deforms from undeformed boundary to deformed boundary, thus preventing contact between frame and flexure component greatly reduces the occurrence of fretting which can be a significant source of wear and eventual failure of suspension systems that experience repetitive contact of elements made of dissimilar materials such as stainless steel flexure component and frame, which may be made of a metal mesh such as aluminum or a molded plastic. The invention may be practiced using other types of suspensions that operate without any sliding contact, such as, air bearings, liquid bearings, and magnetic bearings. Flexure bearings are preferably used because they are simpler and less expensive than other types of nonsliding contact bearings.",

		"patentAbstract": "The system has audio signal processor (12) coupled with bass array (16) through an amplifier (14). The bass array (16) includes two bass modules (22-1,22-2) held in horizontal position by the brackets (18,20). Processor decodes the audio signals and outputs the processed audio signal with different signal processing parameter values indicated by the preset indicators to the speaker input terminal.\n\n\nUsed for sound systems.\n\nThe system provides a bass array that can radiate a predetermined radiation pattern with less set up time than conventional bass arrays. The system is advantageous for portable applications that must provide high amount of acoustic outputs and must be set up quickly. The components of the array can be transported and stored separately. The array can be assembled in correct physical configuration quickly, and correct time delay can be input without the user having to record or memorize the appropriate time delay interval.",

The actuator is adapted to apply an active control force between the body and wheel assembly and moves the wheel assembly over a control range. An upper, lower pivots and relative rotation centers are positioned to produce a horizontal kinetic displacement of the wheel assembly as the actuator moves through the control range.\n\n\nUsed for active suspension of wheeled vehicle such as automobile.\n\nThe suspension has low maximum horizontal kinetic displacement of the wheel assembly and particularly low horizontal inertial and tire loads, thereby making the occupant more compartable. The suspension is adapted to permit the wheel assembly to move relative to the spring body through a jounce and rebound vertical travel, as limited by mechanical stops, thereby reducing the vibration effect. The wheel suspension suspends a rear wheel assembly from a spring body of a wheeled vehicle and defines a geometry selected to produce a maximum longitudinal displacement of less than about 5.0 millimeters.",

The armature has permanent magnets and the stator has multiple phases of coils. The stator is attached to an end of a top cap that affixes to a vehicle body (20). A clamp circuit is powered by movement of the actuator to generate a passive damping characteristic of the actuator.\n\nAn INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for boosting voltage.\n\nUsed generating force and motion between a vehicles body and its wheel assembly to control a vehicles ride quality.\n\nThe actuator provides a desired level of passive damping of motion of a wheel assembly with respect to a vehicle body upon a loss of electrical power. The actuator is configured such that its passive damping characteristics act in concert with other passive suspension components selected for efficient suspension operation under normal conditions, to provide safe handling and a relatively comfortable ride until the vehicle is serviced. The power developed by the actuator activates circuitry to maintain desired passive damping characteristics. The maintenance of the damping characteristics avoids a need for normally closed switches, thus providing a stable shut down mode and increasing overall system efficiency.",

Enables starting of engine without the assistance of separate starter motor and large high powered battery. Reverse gear is eliminated. Engine is stopped rather than idled when at rest, thus fuel consumption and emissions are reduced.

The two orthogonally polarized beams are projected to form an image on a viewing surface.\n\nAn INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for image projector.\n\nFor use in two-dimensional (2D) projection display system such as rear-projection television, portable business projector, fixed installation or conference room projector, large venue digital cinema projector, three-dimensional (3D) projection display system such as VR-3100 stereoscopic projector.\n\nThe need for adjustment of multiple light engines for three-dimensional (3D) viewing is eliminated, by performing alignment of the images when the color management system is fabricated. Cost and size are reduced, by including all of the hardware for projecting 3D images in a single light engine. The brightness of the image on the viewing surface is enhanced by increasing the amount of time that the color switch transmits blue light and green light for 3D image.",

		"patentAbstract": "The method involves receiving an audio signal, and monitoring an acoustic signal comprising components of an interfering signal and the audio signal. A processed audio signal is generated including compressing the audio signal at a compression ratio when the audio signal is at a level determined from the monitored acoustic signal. A relationship between a level of audio signal and the acoustic signal is determined. Presentation characteristics of an audio input signal (131) are determined, where the audio signal input is processed in a headphone unit (110) in a signal processor (120).\n\nINDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:\n(1) an audio processing system comprising a compressor circuit\n(2) a masking module comprising a correlator.\n\nUsed for processing an audio signal.\n\nThe presentation characteristics of the input audio signal are determined, thus reducing distraction from the interfering signal, such as from an ambient noise such as background conversation, background noise from airplanes or trains. The relationship between the level of the audio signal and the acoustic signal is determined without separating the interfering signal present in the monitored acoustic signal from the component related to the input audio signal.",

The volumes (25, 25a) form an inner volume. An amplifier assembly has an amplifier cover holding an amplifier in thermal contact with a heat sink (32). The heat sink has a spine unit via which heat is conducted to fins having large surfaces. Radiation of pressure wave caused by an acoustic driver (22) permit air motion in the inner volume in which the assembly is positioned.\n\n\nUsed for being mounted in a vehicle door (claimed).\n\nThe fins of the heat sink have large surfaces to permit the heat transfer to the external environment. The device permits the inner volume to be used for components, which cause the device to be larger in the direction of cone motion, thus permitting the device to be relatively narrow in the direction of cone motion. The device permits the transmission of more power to the amplifier, thus providing more cone motion and hence permitting more air motion and greater heat transfer capacity to accommodate the greater heat transfer requirement for higher power levels. The cone surface provides protection for the amplifier assembly from water and other environmental components.",

		"patentAbstract": "Chemoelectric generation with fuel cell involves supplying a fuel to an anode (120) of the fuel cell. An oxidizer is supplied to a cathode (130) of the fuel cell. At least two reforming operations of reverse current charging operation, forward current charging operation, oxygen-less operation and/or open circuit operation are performed on the fuel cell. The step of supplying the oxidizer involves decomposing potassium or sodium chlorate, or hydrogen peroxide to provide oxygen. The greater than or equal to2 reforming operations are performed intermittently, simultaneously, or sequentially.\n\nAn INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an apparatus for chemoelectric generation comprising an electrolyte (100) positioned partially between the anode and the cathode; a controllable switch for coupling a load between the anode and the cathode; and a controller constructed and arranged to control the fuel received by the anode, the oxidizer received by the cathode, the controllable switch, and to perform the at least two reforming operations.\n\nThe method is used for chemoelectric generating with fuel cell, e.g. direct methanol fuel cell (110), useful for producing electricity.\n\nThe chemoelectric generation operation uses the controller to monitor various cell performance parameters, e.g. the fuel cell voltage, load current, second power processing circuitry, and energy storage device. The controller monitors fuel cell operating status via status line; monitors fuel cell reversal, the fuel supply status, operating time elapse, and long-term performance decay; and can improve fuel cell performance by monitoring the cell performance parameters and intermittently applying four reforming operations either alone or in combination.",

		"title": "Projection system for e.g. home cinema comprises a source producing polarized light energy in different frequency regions; and a screen polarizer which selectively reflects light energy in the narrow frequency regions and absorbs the rest",
		"patentAbstract": "A light projection system comprises source of polarized light, which causes polarization of light energy in a predetermined number of narrow frequency regions in a first direction and other frequency regions between the narrow frequency regions in a second direction; and a screen having a polarizer constructed and arranged so that light energy in the narrow frequency regions is reflected and in other frequency regions is at least partially absorbed.\n\nINDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following\n(1) an apparatus (M1) comprising, a projection screen having structure constructed and arranged to selectively reflect only incident optical energy of a predetermined number of narrow bands of optical wavelength region and to significantly attenuate reflection of incident optical energy in bands of optical wavelength regions outside the frequency ranges contained in the predetermined number of narrow bands, and in which the projection screen comprises a polarizing layer for transmitting light polarized in a given direction and for absorbing light not polarized in the given direction; and\n(2) a projector comprising a digital-micromirror-device structure for providing light in a predetermined number of narrow bands of optical wavelength regions, in which the light is polarized in the same direction; and a polarization recovery system.\n\nAs a light projection system useful in a projector or an apparatus (claimed) for front-projection display systems e.g. systems used in home cinema or business applications.\n\nThe projection system is improved and provides a high-contrast. The projection screen reflects projector light back to the viewer without reflecting a substantial amount of ambient light from the room. In a dark room also it provides color improvement and absorbs a significant fraction of the projector\u0027s stray light which reflects off the screen and bounces off the walls. That light is largely depolarized when it reflects off the walls, so the polarizer in the screen is still usable in improving contrast ratio. Also, the light that reflects off the walls is largely redirected to high angles where the screen dielectric coating and diffusion layers are constructed and arranged to avoid returning ambient light to the viewer. The high contrast projection screen significantly increases the contrast ratio and improves the color. The multilayer interference coating provides sharp cut-on and cut-off slopes in wavelength selection. Also, it is made with arbitrary positions for the cut-ons and cut-offs. This feature allows adjustment for better color and contrast ratio.",

		"patentAbstract": "The earcup assembly (58) has an enclosure with walls separating an interior of the enclosure from an exterior of the earcup. A driver has a diaphragm, and a port connecting the interior and the exterior of the earcup. The port has a mass that coacts with a compliance of the enclosure to establish a resonant circuit having a resonance at a resonant frequency. An acoustically resistive opening connects the interior and the exterior of the earcup in parallel with the port. A microphone has a pickup surface and is mounted on an outer edge of the diaphragm.\n\n\nUsed in a circumaural noise reduction headset (claimed) that is used for placing in ears of a user.\n\nThe port and the acoustically resistive opening allows active attenuation to be attained with significantly smaller back cavity, thus providing a larger front cavity for a given earcup size, and hence improving passive attenuation. The earcup provides a smooth frequency response and the driver is efficient, thus facilitating use of simpler electronic circuitry, and hence reducing power consumption significantly in battery powered active noise reduction headsets.",

		"patentAbstract": "The method involves monitoring operating conditions of the battery of a vehicle. The monitored conditions of the battery are compared with a preset state. An alarm e.g. audible alarm, is triggered if one of the monitored operating conditions of the battery reaches the preset state. An output voltage level of the battery, discharge current of the battery and ambient temperature are sensed. The vehicle is caused to start the engine if one of the monitored operating conditions of the battery reaches the preset state.\n\n\nMethod for operating a dual-mode audio system in a vehicle. Uses include but are not limited to self-propelled passenger vehicle for land transport, car, truck, pick-up truck and sport utility vehicle.\n\nThe method allows monitoring of operating conditions of the battery of the vehicle to estimate the approximate amount of energy remaining in the battery, thus ensuring that sufficient charge is remained in the battery to re-start the automobile.",

		"patentAbstract": "A linear electromagnetic actuator (100) has ferromagnetic poles and permanent magnets (110) interacting with the poles to induce movement of actuator along a path, with the poles having non-uniform configurations. The configurations reduce detent force occurring along the path and do not affect force output of actuator over a range of motion of the actuator. The configurations of the poles include different widths of the poles. The widths of the poles vary such that detent forces between the poles and the permanent magnets are of lesser variation than those resulting from uniform widths.\n\nINDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for\n(1) method;\n(2) active suspension system\n\nApparatus for detent force correcting in linear electromagnetic actuator.\n\nChanges are made to the design of the linear actuator so that collectively, they reduce the detent force but do not change the force output of the actuator. This can be done by assuring that individual changes are small, resulting in significant changes to detent force without significantly increasing or decreasing force output during active operation. As a result, reduced energy for overcoming passive detent forces in a linear motor and improved smoothness of linear motor operation are attained.",

An enclosure (102) is coupled to the transducer, and a secondary resonant element is coupled to the enclosure.

The output impedance can be reduced using negative current feedback, so that the frequency response of the sound pressure output of the loudspeaker system can be flattened around the secondary resonance and the displacement of the drone can be reduced, thus improving reliability of the audio system. The current-controlled synthesized output impedance allows drone damping control without utilizing a power dissipating element.",

The cushion with the openings provides additional damping to smooth audio response at the ear of the user.\n\n\nHeadset.\n\nThe headset actively and passively reduces noise perceived by the user. The size of the ear cup is small and provides effective volume by acoustically adding volume of the cushion to volume of the ear cup.

		"patentAbstract": "The system has a force bias eliminator and an electromagnetic actuator connected to an energy source, and a load-unload detector for detecting loading or unloading of a plant e.g. seat. A control system is operably coupled to the load-unload detector, the force bias eliminator and the actuator. The control system controls the actuator to preserve energy available from the energy source while the force bias eliminator responds to counteract the forces. The load-unload detector comprises a pressure switch that is located on a surface of the plant.\n\nINDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:\n(1) a method for controlling an active suspension system\n(2) a vehicle seat system comprising a force bias eliminator.\n\nActive suspension system. Uses include but are not limited to a seat of a passenger car, a floor of a cargo truck, weapons platform of a military vehicle, boat, ship and an aircraft.\n\nThe system enables the force bias eliminator to respond quickly while controlling the fast-responding of the actuator so as to preserve the available energy for operating the actuator. The system directly measures the energy stored in the energy source, and the controller can predict the level and discharge rate of available electrical energy, so that force bias eliminator ensures fast response time. The controller can immediately respond to the force bias eliminator to counteract the load-unload event and actively manage the power drawn by the actuator so as to manage the energy source rapidly. The load-unload detector can detect the occurrence of loading/unloading quickly.",

Reduces the number of unique components that must be stocked in a factory that makes more than one model of vehicle, and provides aftermarket systems that are pre-tuned by their manufacturer to provide optimal signal processing for the stock electro-acoustic transducers in each of potential vehicle models. Amplifier is used for diagnostics, such as to determine whether and identify which of the electro-acoustic transducers or electro-acoustic transducer housings are damaged or determine whether the proper electro-acoustic transducers have been installed in a particular model of vehicle to reduce manufacturing errors and related costs.",

The wireless network is automatically reorganized according to the behavior of the user with respect to time in order to minimize disruptions in the wireless network resulting from the removal of personal portable devices by the user, by positioning the personal portable devices that have lesser extents of interaction within the network at specific positions for reducing the loss of the point-to-point links. The disruption resulting due to loss of all point-to- point links caused by the removal of personal portable device can be reduced, for continuing communication between the remaining personal portable devices. The recreation of the network can be performed at predefined time to establish new point-to-point links on an uncoordinated basis, and reorganize the point-to-point links to conform to the selection of the personal portable device that occupies the center position. The failure in the formation of new point-to-point link due to collisions between the separate and uncoordinated efforts by the personal portable devices to locate each other can be prevented. The possibility of unwanted additional device to form a point-to-point link with one of the personal portable devices can be reduced, depending on the protocols used for establishing the new point-to-point links, for improving the network security.",

The transmission converts the rotation of the first rotary motor in a first direction, and a simultaneous rotation of the secondary motor in a second direction to linear motion of an output shaft (120) in a single direction. The first and second rotary motors are arranged serially and rotates around a common axis (114).\n\n\nAutomobile suspension for coupling wheel assembly to sprung mass.\n\nProvides a linear actuator in a package space and enables using compact rotary actuators without imparting reaction torque to the surrounding structure since the transmission converts the rotation of the first rotary motor in a first direction, and a simultaneous rotation of the secondary motor in a second direction to linear motion of an output shaft in a single direction. Improves flexibility in component size and packaging by using a transmission that has a non-unity ratio. Increases the total volume of air available in the system and decreasing the pressure change in the bellows since the air channel is formed by a bore and the bents permits air to flow between the bellows and the volume at the opposite end of the motor housing. Prevents the output shaft from colliding with the motor housing when fully retracted by providing a bump stop. Prevents the output shaft from colliding with the motor housing when fully extended by providing a rebound stop.",

		"patentAbstract": "The method involves decomposing two-channel input audio signals into a set of two-channel subband audio signals, and generating three subband audio signals in a set of subbands by steering the two-channel subband audio signals in three generated signal locations. A set of output audio signals is synthesized from the generated subband audio signals, where the steering of the two-channel subband audio signals is performed to apply differing construction rules in two of the subbands. The generated subband audio signals are recombined into an output audio signal.\n\n\nMethod for processing a two-channel input audio signal to construct an output audio signal in a speaker system.\n\nThe method allows extracting correlated signal from left and right sidebands to reduce the noise, thus improving the quality of the received signal, and enables decomposing the stereo signal into separate signals for playback over spatially distributed speakers in an efficient manner.",

		"patentAbstract": "The suspension has an upper structural member coupled to a wheel assembly to define upper relative rotation center and rotationally connected to a sprung body at an upper pivot. A lower structural member is coupled to the assembly to define lower relative rotation center located on a side of gravitational center of the assembly opposite to the upper relative rotation center and rotationally connected to the body at a lower pivot. The suspension defines geometry to produce maximum lateral displacement of center of the assembly through vertical travel, where the displacement is less than 10 mm.\n\n\nRear wheel active suspension for suspending a rear wheel assembly from a sprung body of an automobile i.e. car.\n\nThe suspension improves comfort level of the occupant. The suspension makes the secondary forces associated with small horizontal wheel motions to become perceptible and subjectively objectionable when pitch, roll and vertical body motions and vibrations are reduced or eliminated by an active suspension system of appropriate bandwidth. The damping mass of the assembly is such that horizontal wheel inertia can be increased and induced loads can be exaggerated. The suspension controls the vehicle body to move at a desired speed along a linear path when the wheels are actively moved up and down over road surface irregularities. The suspension permits the wheel assembly to easily move relative to the sprung body through a jounce and rebound vertical travel when limited by mechanical stops.",

An actuator (16) is connected to both the wheel assembly and the spring body to define an upper relative rotation center, and is rotationally coupled to the spring body at the upper pivot (62). The upper and lower pivots and relative rotation centers are positioned to generate a maximum horizontal kinetic displacement of the wheel assembly of less than about 4.0 millimeters as the actuator moves through an active control range.\n\nThe coupling between the lower structural member and the wheel assembly defines a lower relative rotation center set on the side of a gravitational center (68) of the wheel assembly, opposite the upper relative rotation center. The actuator applies an active control force between the spring body and the wheel assembly, to move the wheel assembly over the active control range comprising at least 60 percent of the vertical travel of the wheel assembly.\n\nActive wheel suspension system for wheeled motor vehicle e.g. automobile.\n\nImproves vehicle passengers comfort and vehicle performance, while offering low maximum horizontal kinetic displacement of wheel assembly and lower horizontal inertial and tire loads as suspension moves through jounce and rebound under active control.",

A degree of a feedback-based ANR provided in response to the external microphone on detecting a higher sound level is increased.

The device reduces creation of unwanted noise sounds. The device has a compression controller storing new variable gain amplifier (VGA) settings into a selected buffer out of two buffers, where the buffers are synchronized to allow flow of pieces of digital data through the VGAs and the settings stored in the selected buffer are provided to the VGAs, thus avoiding generation of audible artifacts. The method enables avoiding or mitigating creation of audible distortions or undesired audio artifacts arising from changes during an operation of the device, where the changes in interconnections, quantities of components, types of components, filter coefficients and/or VGA gain values are ideally buffered so as to enable coordination of interconnections, quantities, types, coefficients and values with different data transfer rates.

		"title": "Support method for talk-through audio in personal active noise reduction (ANR) device, involves operating filters to reduce feedforward-based ANR and enable human speech sounds to be conveyed to first acoustic driver with less attenuation",
		"patentAbstract": "The support method involves awaiting receipt of an indication of a manually-operable control being operated to enable talk-through is awaited. A first group of filters is then operated in response to receiving the indication of the manually-operable control being operated to reduce the degree of feedforward-based ANR provided by the first group of filters, and to enable human speech sounds to be conveyed from the first feedforward microphone to the first acoustic driver with less attenuation caused by the provision of feedforward-based ANR by the first group of filters.\n\nThe first group of filters is configured in a feedforward-based ANR pathway of a first ANR circuit (2000) of the personal ANR device (1000) with a first set of filter coefficients to provide feedforward-based ANR. The feedforward-based ANR employs a first feed-forward microphone (130) coupled to the first ANR circuit to detect environmental sounds and a first acoustic driver (190) coupled to the first ANR circuit to acoustically output feedforward anti-noise sounds to reduce the environmental sounds. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for the apparatus comprising the ANR circuit.\n\nSupport method for talk-through audio in personal ANR device. Can be used in personal ANR device, such as headphones, two-way communications headsets, earphones, earbuds, wireless headsets or earsets and ear protectors, providing feedforward-based ANR.\n\nReduces acoustic noise in the vicinity of the user\u0027s ears. Provides ANR in relatively small spaces in which a person may sit or stand, including and not limited to, phone booths and car passenger cabins. Uses a processing device which may be caused to operate the interface to monitor a signal from the power source that is indicative of the power available from the power source, and to dynamically switch between different sets of filter coefficients, gain settings, clock frequencies and switching device configurations in response to changes in the amount of available power. Ensures that the processing device may be caused to dynamically switch between different sets of filter coefficients, gain settings, clock frequencies and switching device configurations to perform simplification, with the added benefit of a reduction in power consumption. Ensures that the close interconnection of digital filters may ease the task of dynamically configuring a pathway to add or remove digital filters with a minimum of changes to the interconnections that define that pathway.",

		"title": "Audio noise reduction circuit for use in e.g. over-the-head headphone worn by user in vicinity of user\u0027s ears, has audio noise reduction settings buffer storing failsafe settings to configure settings in response to instance of instability",
		"patentAbstract": "The circuit (2000) has a pathway e.g. feedback-based audio noise reduction (ANR) pathway, through which digital data representing sounds flow from an analog-to-digital converter to a digital-to-analog converter through a set of digital filters. First and second ANR settings buffers are alternately employed in configuring multiple ANR settings in synchronization with a transfer of a piece of digital data transferred through the pathway. Third ANR settings buffer stores multiple failsafe ANR settings to configure the ANR settings in response to a detected instance of instability.\n\nAn INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for configuring audio noise reduction setting of an audio noise reduction circuit.\n\nAudio noise reduction (ANR) circuit for use in a personal ANR device e.g. headphone such as over-the-head headphone and behind-the-neck headphone, two-way communication headset such as single-ear headset, earphone e.g. in-ear earphone, ear bud, wireless headset or ear set, and ear protector, worn by a user in vicinity of user\u0027s ears to provide ANR functionality for user\u0027s ears. Can also be used for hat or helmet incorporating earpieces to enable audio communication and/or ear protection, phone booth and car passenger cabin.\n\nThe method enables providing a set of analog-to-digital converter circuits (ADCs) to employ a variant of sigma-delta ACD algorithm for power conservation to extend battery life and inherent ability to reduce digital data representing audible noise sounds that are introduced as a result of the conversion process. The device reduces creation of unwanted noise sounds. The device has a compression controller storing new variable gain amplifier (VGA) settings into a selected buffer out of two buffers, where the buffers are synchronized to allow flow of pieces of digital data through the VGAs and the settings stored in the selected buffer are provided to the VGAs, thus avoiding generation of audible artifacts. The method enables avoiding or mitigating creation of audible distortions or undesired audio artifacts arising from changes during an operation of the device, where the changes in interconnections, quantities of components, types of components, filter coefficients and/or VGA gain values are ideally buffered so as to enable coordination of interconnections, quantities, types, coefficients and values with different data transfer rates. The method enables reducing gain of the device in response to relatively low environmental noise sound levels, thus enabling use of lower cost microphones.",

The circuit provides an output signal conveying feedback and feedforward anti-noise sounds, and the pass-through audio sounds to be acoustically output by an acoustic driver (190).\n\n\nPersonal audio noise reduction (ANR) device e.g. headphone such as over-the-head headphone and behind-the-neck headphone, two-way communications headset such as single-ear headset, earphone e.g. in-ear earphone, ear bud, wireless headset or ear set, and ear protector, for being worn by a user in vicinity of user\u0027s ears to provide ANR functionality for a user\u0027s ears. Can also be used for hat or helmet incorporating earpieces to enable audio communication and/or ear protection, phone booth and car passenger cabin.\n\nThe device has the audio noise reduction ANR circuit incorporating signal processing topology to support provision of feedback-based ANR, feedforward-based ANR and pass-through audio in which the topology incorporates three branches for generating feedback anti-noise sounds, feedforward anti-noise sounds and modified pass-through audio sounds, where the generated sounds are combined into a single output by which the driver easily drives the device. The device has a set of analog-to-digital converter circuits (ADCs) to employ a variant of sigma-delta ADC algorithm for power conservation to extend battery life and inherent ability to reduce digital data representing audible noise sounds that is introduced as a result of the conversion process. The device reduces creation of unwanted noise sounds. The device enables reducing gain of the device in response to relatively low environmental noise sound levels, thus enabling use of lower cost microphones.",

Uses include but are not limited to headphone, two-way communication headset, earphone, earbud, wireless headset and ear protector.\n\nEnables convertible filter to be dynamically configured to be operable as different types of digital filter through selective provision of power to differing ones of the power conductors. Creation of block of filters at single point along the pathway easily enables alterations in the characteristics of filtering performed in the pathway. Close interconnection of digital filters eases the task of dynamically configuring the pathway to add or remove digital filters with minimum of changes to interconnections that define the pathway. Power conservation is enabled by employing different data transfer rates along different pathways of digital data representing sounds in signal processing topology. Enables reduction in power consumption and/or in introduction of noise sounds by allowing the combining function of one or the other of the summing nodes to be disabled or at least not be utilized. Reduces power consumption of convertible filter and enables convertible filter to be operated as finite impulse response (FIR) filter since delay elements and weighting elements are deprived of power by programming the power switch to disconnect power from the power conductor. Enables greater power conservation since all of the delay and weight elements of convertible filter are able to be deprived of power at times when convertible filter is not being used in addition to the power conductor being provided with power through the power switch. The number of different types of filters that must be incorporated into the filter block is reduced and flexibility is increased by providing filters that can be dynamically configured to be operated either way without incurring unnecessary consumption of power where one of the convertible filters is to be operated as FIR filter.",

		"patentAbstract": "The method involves providing a motion directing calibration signal of predetermined frequency content to cause a motion control system to provide current to a set of phases of a multiphase motor (12) that comprises an armature (16). The current provided to the set of phases is commutated such that net force with the predetermined frequency content is zero if an actual position of the armature corresponds to position information.

Uses include but are not limited to a car, truck, boat, train, bus, recreational vehicle, ambulance, tractor, truck-trailer and an airplane.\n\nThe method enables self-calibrating the control system when a component is replaced, so that recalibration of the entire motion controls system when any one component is replaced at a factory by a skilled technician using expensive and specialized fixtures and measuring equipment is eliminated. The armature moves at constant velocity at a relatively low frequency to zero force positions to calibrate the system or to increase motor efficiency. The proper calibration of the motion control system reduces power consumption and the heat produced by the motion control system.",

The method combines an audio receiver and a supplemental speaker system into a single unit in which functions of a controller are performed by an audio processor of the speaker system, thus reducing cost of entire system. The method uses peak values and peak locations, thus greatly reducing an amount of computation of the system.

		"title": "Loudspeaker for pocket sized electronic device has first and second motors that are arranged such that free body torques from rotation of first and second lever arms is less than that when only one lever arm rotates",
		"patentAbstract": "The loudspeaker has a first lever arm (16A) that couples the armature of a first motor and an acoustic diaphragm (10A), and is coupled to a first pivot (24A) so that motion of the armature rotates the first arm, resulting in free body torque about the first pivot. A second lever arm (16B) couples the armature of the second motor and the diaphragm such that motion of the armature rotates the second arm to result in free body torque about a second pivot (24B). The motors are arranged such that the free body torques from the rotation of the lever arms is less than that when only one arm rotates.\n\n\nLoudspeaker for pocket sized electronic device e.g. cell phone, personal data assistant, communication device, pocket sized computer.\n\nEnsures that the pivot and the lever arms provide ample stiffness sufficient to resist then maximum crashing force relative to displacement in the Y direction. Ensures that the relative motion between the magnetic structure and the core is minimized due to high Y-axis stiffness of the pivot. Ensures that less mechanical vibration is transmitted to the structure to which the loudspeaker is rigidly coupled, thus requiring less vibration damping and less stiffening of the structure that is mechanically coupled to the loudspeaker. Enables provision of a moving magnet architecture that makes it simpler to achieve torque cancellation and moment balance.",

		"patentAbstract": "The apparatus has primary and secondary microphones (102,104) that generate primary and secondary input signals (108,110) with voice and noise components. A mixing circuit (106) applies primary gain and secondary gain with specific value to the respective input signals to produce primary and secondary scaled signals (128,130) that are added to produce a summed signal (134). An adaptive filter (122) computes an updated value to minimize the energy of the summed signal based on the summed signal and the input signals, and to provide the updated value to the mixing circuit.\n\nAn INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for method of combining signals.\n\nApparatus for combining signals for rejecting noise such as ambient noise from environment such other people talking noise traffic noise and machinery noise, and wind noise in microphones of headset such as wired headset and wireless headset e.g. Bluetooth for communicating through telecommunication system. Can also be used in other communication devices used in noisy environments, such as portable speaker phone and conferencing system.\n\nSince the mixing circuit combines the signals from the two microphones to produce an output signal that includes a strong voice component and little noise. Thus the noise in the resulting signal can be minimized. Since the total energy in the mixed signal is minimized by the adaptive filter, simple and cost-effective implantation can be obtained.",

The ground conductor of the microphone and the ground conductor of the acoustic driver are employed as a ground return of the electric power.

The method enables active noise reduction circuit to employ a variety of forms of active noise reduction to reduce a level of environmental acoustic noise in a vicinity of a user\u0027s ears, thus enabling the user to more easily hear an audio when the user wish to hear from the aviation intercom system and wireless/wired device and performing various other functions beyond simply enabling the user of the headset to interact with the aviation intercom system. The method enables circuitry carried within a control box to be incorporated into earpieces, thus possibly obviating the need for a mid assembly to incorporate the control box and permitting an entirety of the mid assembly to be eliminated when an upper assembly is directly coupled to a lower assembly. The method enables the control box to differ from the control box in a power multiplexer that is capable of accepting and employing aircraft-Video Control Cabinet to provide electric power on the video control cabinet conductor, and is capable of accepting and employing electric power from an injected voltage tap or the local power source, so that the power multiplexer detects a provision of that aircraft-Video Control Cabinet, where the headset is coupled via an interface to another aircraft aviation intercom system providing a Lemocompliant interface when a conductor providing an aircraft- video control cabinet is available, thus avoiding draining of the local power source.",

		"patentAbstract": "The component i.e. unitary plastic element (32), has an acoustic volume portion that is acoustically energized by an electro-acoustic driver. A port extends from the acoustic volume portion and conducts acoustic energy from the acoustic volume portion toward environment external to a loudspeaker in which the plastic element resides. Another port conducts acoustic energy from another acoustic volume portion defined by the loudspeaker toward external environment, where the plastic element is arranged such that the electro-acoustic driver is secured to the plastic element.\n\nAn INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a loudspeaker comprising a housing.\n\nLoudspeaker component i.e. unitary plastic element.\n\nThe component is arranged in a manner such that the electro-acoustic driver can be secured to the component. The component includes features that enable the component and parts of the loudspeaker to be secured together, and is designed to reside within an acoustic volume portion. The component defines a moat that surrounds an end portion of the port such that an end portion of the port extends at distance along direction in which acoustic energy travels, so that no adhesive can flow into the port when liquid adhesive is placed in the moat and a loudspeaker part is pressed into the moat, thus resulting in reduced audio artifacts such as whistling. The component provides arrangement of a motor and port entrance to ensure efficient packaging, thus resulting in a small sized loudspeaker. The driver is mounted to the component, so that the motor resides in the acoustic volume part, thus reducing length of the loudspeaker. The component has a round port entrance to allow a round motor structure of the motor to get close to port entrance without producing unwanted noise.",

		"patentAbstract": "The apparatus has two audio channels respectively including two class-D amplifiers for receiving input audio signals. Two reconstruction filters respectively receive outputs from the class-D amplifiers and reconstruct output audio signals for driving a speaker system, where a second planar inductor of the second reconstruction filter and a first planar inductor (24) of the first reconstruction filter are magnetically coupled with each other. A feedback loop provides a signal from an output of the first reconstruction filter back to the first amplifier.\n\nAn INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an apparatus for amplifying an audio signal.\n\nApparatus for providing an audio signal to drive a speaker system in a portable and compact audio application i.e. automotive application.\n\nThe apparatus eliminates cross-talk between nearby planar inductors by proper feedback so as to construct amplifiers including small footprints with inexpensive planar inductors. The first and second class-D audio amplifier output signals are modulated in-phase so as to reduce electromagnetic interference, thus reducing pop noise during amplifier start-up and shut-down, and causing the reconstruction filters to work properly with center-pole gapped coupled planar inductor structures. The planar inductors are placed on a separate daughter board, and can be mounted perpendicular to a printed circuit board containing the class-D audio amplifiers for the channels, thus reducing physical footprint of the speaker system. The feedback loop is operated to correct errors arising from non-linearity at the audio output so as to correct total harmonic distortion and distortion that arises from magnetic coupling of planar inductors in the channel, thus allows positioning the channels closer to each other, and hence arranging the speaker system in a physically smaller layout in an inexpensive manner.",
