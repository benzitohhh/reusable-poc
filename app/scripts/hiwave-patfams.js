The arrays of transducer units range from as low as 20 to as high as 750 acoustic.

Drive signal producing means involves phase shifting higher acoustic content and is also operative for in- phase action of some of the transducers in subarea of the array for lower frequency content.\n\nAcoustic transducers are of following types: pistonic-action, cone-drive, electrostatic, piezoelectric, electromechanical film type.\n\nFor center, front stereo and rear surround sound units in homes, theaters and other public address applications.\n\nEvenness of radiated sound frequencies and perceived diffuse sound effects.",

The number of complex zeros in intervals are identified. The quantized lengths and measure of the number of complex zeros up to predetermined rank are recorded as a representation of the variation of the input parameter.\n\nThe method involves recording number of first rank zeros in the intervals of the input parameter up to predetermined rank which is 1. The coding method is a time encoded signal processing and recognition (TESPAR) method. A code number is generated taking one of set of preset values representing the duration of the interval and the number of complex zeros for at least some of the intervals. S\u0027 matrix is calculated to record the number of instances of each code number in the recorded variation of the input parameter. An A\u0027 matrix is calculated to record the number of instances of a first code number following a second code number with a preset lag. A DZ\u0027 matrix is calculated to record the number of instances of amplitude, length of interval and number of maxima and minima. The input parameters are generated by scanning the handwriting. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:\n(a) handwriting coding device;\n(b) handwriting recognition apparatus;\n(c) handwriting coding program\n\nUsed in notebook type computer systems called palm top computer systems for recognition of handwriting such as signatures.\n\nEnables providing writing tablet for capturing input parameters. Since number of first rank zeros are recorded, sufficient detail for useful characterization is provided without requiring excessive calculation.",

To provide maximum flexibility for optimized sound performance, the subwoofer section can be made to pivot independently of bending-wave panel loudspeaker. The dipole subwoofer can be made to move closely to match the acoustical behavior of bending wave panel loudspeaker especially in its interaction in real space.

The displacement transducers induce local bending (44) in the panel by operating in anti-phase, inducing extension (A) and compression (B) on either side of the neutral plane. Transducer position, core properties and coupling to the panel may be varied.\n\n\nThe panel-form bending wave loudspeaker is used for distributed mode audio reproduction.\n\nSince the transducers are located close to the neutral plane, a wider bandwidth is possible, undesirable stiffening and inertia contributions are minimized and, additionally, the panel can be made small. Positioning can be adjusted to balance loudness against bandwidth.",

		"patentAbstract": "The acoustic radiator or diaphragm (2) is made of a sheet material to define an acoustically active area (13). It has several integral-stiffening members (9) in the form of a corrugation extending out of the plane of the sheet. The stiffening member has a U-shaped cross-section. The sheet has uniform thickness over the acoustically active area within the limits imposed by integral form of the stiffening member.\n\nThe acoustic radiator is made by forming a sheet into a panel with at least one internal corrugation member extending out of the plane of the sheet and at least partly across the sheet. This contributes to the sheet stiffness and enables propagation of bending waves. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are disclosed for loudspeaker using the diaphragm and a method of making the diaphragm\n\nAcoustic radiator is used in loudspeakers.\n\nThe transducer region on the diaphragm can be stiffened for better HF performance at no extra cost. The center of stiffness can be easily shifted for improved modality at geometrically non-optimized transducer locations. The form and depth of the stiffening member allows control over bending wave properties of the diaphragm. Higher acoustic efficiency is obtained. Random patterning of the stiffening members allows higher randomness of vibrations.",

Electrodes (4,5) are arranged on opposite surfaces of the element. The electrodes are used for applying a high electric field to polarize the initially unpolarized piezoelectric ceramic and also for applying a lower electric field to cause the piezoelectric ceramic material to expand in the polarization direction. An electrode construction (23) comprising an electrically conductive foil (21) and a conductive adhesive layer (22) is arranged on top of the electrode.\n\nAny actuation charge delivered to the foil can be connected to the whole of the piezoelectric element via the electrode (4), even if there is a loss of continuity over the whole surface of the ceramic member as a result of fracture.\n\nFor transducers that convert movement to electricity, e.g. in microphone applications, as well as in the actuator applications.\n\nThe electrode is capable of a yield strain greater than that of the electrostrictive member. As a result the electrode will stretch but not break so as to accommodate any deformation of the electrostrictive member that may cause a fracture in that member. Electrical continuity is maintained and the entire ceramic member continues to operate in spite of being fractured.",

Ensures that all bus communications are under direct control of a single node on the bus due to use of routers. Negates need to wait for a particular time slot before communication takes place. Achieves real time performance and there is no requirement for a global timebase to be distributed across all nodes within the network.

		"patentAbstract": "The addressing method involves providing signal conductor (170) to which devices of array are linked, inputting first signal to first location on conductor, and inputting second signal to second location on conductor after chosen time delay such that first and second signals interfere at predetermined location. A signal exceeding threshold is generated so as to address the specific device (P) linked to conductor at predetermined location.\n\nINDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:\n(1) an addressing apparatus;\n(2) a data storage apparatus; and\n(3) a stored data retrieving method.\n\nAddressing method of specific device in array of devices.\n\nImproves the accuracy of the addressing, resolution and memory size by properly taking into account transmission line losses and dispersion. Creates sufficiently well defined superposed threshold pulses even when the line is damped by internal resistance of inductors. Ensures reliable detection since the total damping resistance of the transmission line is less than the characteristic impedance.",

		"title": "Method for generating e.g. sensation of button click to user, in touch sensitive device, involves applying filter with output model parameters to input signal from transducer to generate vibration within touch-sensitive member",
		"patentAbstract": "The method involves determining an initial estimate of a filter (S100) to be applied to a signal input from a transducer to a touch-sensitive member. A time impulse response is determined for the filtered input signal. A reference error value is calculated (S104) for a model by comparing the model with a measured value. A recalculated error value is compared with the reference error value. The filter with output model parameters is applied to the input signal from the transducer to generate vibration within the member to provide a desired haptic sensation.\n\nAn INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a touch sensitive device comprising a touch-sensitive member.\n\nMethod for generating a desired haptic sensation e.g. sensation of button click to user, or complex sensations such as sliding, pitching or rotating fingers on screen, in a touch sensitive device (claimed).\n\nThe method enables providing the desired haptic sensation so as to provide the sensation of the button click to the user and to generate a complex haptic signal to provide additional information to the user by using a haptic feedback signal associated with a user action or gesture. The method enables modeling the filter in a time domain and enables applying an iterative refinement algorithm so as to improve the performance of the filter.",

		"patentAbstract": "The device has a transducer (32) mounted to a touch sensitive sensor (30) or a touch sensitive screen/panel. A processor performs bespoke control process (16). A processor connected device uses a context map (31) to enable signals to be provided to the transducer. The transducer couples vibrational energy to the sensor to provide haptic feedback. The processor connected device receives touch data (34) from the sensor. The process uploads the context map to the processor connected device. The processor connected device calculates the signals applied to the transducer by applying algorithms.\n\nThe control process is an operating system. The processor is a central processor, primary processor, peripheral processor and a secondary processor. The processor connected device is a touch controller (33), haptics controller (38) and a combined touch and haptics controller. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a touch input device for generating contextual haptic feedback.\n\nTouch sensitive device for generating contextual haptic feedback provided to a personal computer touch pad and a mobile/cellular telephone.\n\nThe device allows haptic response information to be provided to the transducers such that the contextual haptic feedback can be generated without need for the control process used to carry out processing, thus allowing time delay between a touch event and provision of contextual haptic feedback response to be reduced.",
